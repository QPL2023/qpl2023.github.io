    "content": "The 20th International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL 2023) will\ntake place from 17 July to 21 July 2023 at Institut Henri\nPoincaré in Paris, France.  Quantum Physics and Logic\nis an annual conference that brings together academic and industry researchers\nworking on mathematical foundations of quantum computation, quantum physics,\nand related areas. The main focus is on the use of algebraic and categorical\nstructures, formal languages, type systems, semantic methods, as well as other\nmathematical and computer scientific techniques applicable to the study of\nphysical systems, physical processes, and their composition. Work applying\nquantum-inspired techniques and structures to other fields (such as\nlinguistics, artificial intelligence, and causality) is also welcome.\n\nImportant Dates\n\n\n  Abstract submission deadline: 1 March 12 March 2023\n  Paper submission deadline: 7 March 17 March 2023\n  Notification: 1 May 2023\n  Camera-ready deadline: 1 July 2023\n  Conference: 17 July – 21 July 2023\n\n\nAll deadlines are stated with respect to the Anywhere on Earth (AoE) time zone.\n\nSubmissions\n\nProspective speakers are invited to submit one (or more) of the following:\n\n\n  Proceedings submission. This consists of a 5-12 page paper. It must\nprovide sufficient evidence of results of genuine interest, in sufficient\ndetail for the program committee to assess the merits of the work.\nSubmissions of work in progress are encouraged, but must be more substantial\nthan a research proposal. Proceedings submissions should be prepared using\nthe EPTCS style files.\n  Non-proceedings submission. This consists of a 3 page summary, together with\na link to a separate published paper or preprint. If the published paper or\npreprint is not publicly available (e.g., not open access), then it should be\nincluded in full after the summary.\n  Poster submission. This consists of a 3 page abstract of partial results or\nwork in progress.\n  Programming tool submission. This consists of a 3 page description of a\nprogramming tool or framework, with a strong preference for open-source\ncontributions.\n\n\nPage limits exclude bibliography and appendices (which may be read at the\ndiscretion of reviewers). All submissions will be handled by\nEasyChair.\n\nThere will be an award for Best Student Paper that will be determined by the\nProgram Committee. Papers eligible for the award are those where all the\nauthors are students at the time of submission.\n\nRegistration\n\nRegistration is now open. More information is available here.\n\nPresentations\n\nAuthors of accepted proceedings and non-proceedings submissions will be invited\nto give a talk. Authors of accepted poster submissions will be invited to present\ntheir work at the poster session. Authors of accepted programming tool\nsubmissions will be invited to live demo their tool to conference attendees.\n\nThe conference program is available here.\n\nConference Proceedings\n\nConference proceedings will be published in Electronic Proceedings in\nTheoretical Computer Science (EPTCS) after the\nconference. When preparing the final version for publication, authors of\naccepted proceedings submissions are allowed to use up to three extra pages\n(i.e. up to 15 pages excluding bibliography) to address reviewer concerns and\nsuggestions under the provisio that they do not introduce new results.\n\nLocal Information\n\nThe conference will take place at Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris, France.\n\n\n\nParis has a dense public transportation network: metro, bus, tram and RER (regional train). A single one-way ticket costs 2.10€. There also are packs and day passes. Notice that RER outside Paris (e.g. from/to airports) has specific fares. See also local travel advice from IHP.\n\nThe two amphitheaters, Hermite and Darboux, are located on the ground floor.\nCoffee breaks will be held in between the morning sessions, and in between the afternoon sessions, in the space next to the two amphitheaters.\nPlease do not eat or drink anything (except water) inside the amphitheaters.\nAn additional room on the ground floor is at our disposal.\n\nWe are also given access to the library on the first floor of the building. The only requirement is to simply fill in the registration list at the entrance of the library. The library is quite nice and it is worth checking out!\n\nEduroam is accessible on site.\n\nAlternatively, you may use the “IHP-Guest” network, which can be accessed using the following procedure:\n\n  Select the “IHP-Guest” network.\n  In the pop-up window, click on the button “Receive your credentials on this portal”.\n  Fill in the form, and click “Register”.\n  You get your credentials for the current day.\n  Clicking “Back”, you get to the registration portal, but the credentials should be filled in. Click on “Connect”. You now have access to the internet.\n\n\nThe conference dinner will take place at “Les Belles Plantes” located at 47 Rue Cuvier. It is a short walk (approximately 15 minutes) from the conference venue.\nThe dinner will be vegetarian with vegan options available upon request.\n\nLunches are not provided by the conference organisers. There are many restaurants and food options close to the conference venue.\n\nDiamond Sponsor\n\n\nGold Sponsor\n\n\nSilver Sponsor\n\n\nOrganisational Support and Funding\n\n\nProgramme Committee Co-chairs\n\n\n  Shane Mansfield (Quandela)\n  Benoît Valiron (LMF, CentraleSupelec, Université Paris-Saclay)\n  Vladimir Zamdzhiev (Inria, LMF)\n\n\nProgramme Committee\n\n\n  Pablo Arrighi (Université Paris-Saclay, LMF)\n  Miriam Backens (University of Birmingham)\n  Jonathan Barrett (University of Oxford)\n  Alessandro Bisio (Università di Pavia)\n  Titouan Carette (Center for Quantum Computing Science, University of Latvia)\n  Ulysse Chabaud (Inria)\n  Giulio Chiribella (The University of Hong Kong)\n  Bob Coecke (Quantinuum)\n  Alejandro Díaz-Caro (Universidad Nacional de Quilmes &amp; ICC (CONICET / Universidad de Buenos Aires))\n  Ross Duncan (Quantinuum)\n  Pierre-Emmanuel Emeriau (Quandela)\n  Yuan Feng (University of Technology Sydney)\n  Stefano Gogioso (University of Oxford)\n  Amar Hadzihasanovic (Tallinn University of Technology)\n  Emmanuel Jeandel (LORIA)\n  Martti Karvonen (University of Ottawa)\n  Kohei Kishida (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign)\n  Aleks Kissinger (University of Oxford)\n  Ravi Kunjwal (Université libre de Bruxelles)\n  Simon Martiel (Atos Quantum Lab)\n  Konstantinos Meichanetzidis (Quantinuum)\n  Mio Murao (The University of Tokyo)\n  Ognyan Oreshkov (Université libre de Bruxelles)\n  Prakash Panangaden (McGill University)\n  Simon Perdrix (LORIA)\n  Neil Ross (Dalhousie University)\n  Ana Belén Sainz (ICTQT, University of Gdansk)\n  Carlo Maria Scandolo (University of Calgary)\n  John Selby (ICTQT, University of Gdansk)\n  Peter Selinger (Dalhousie University)\n  Rui Soares Barbosa (INL – International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory)\n  Pawel Sobocinski (Tallinn University of Technology)\n  Isar Stubbe (Université du Littoral)\n  Augustin Vanrietvelde (Inria, LMF)\n  Renaud Vilmart (Inria, LMF)\n  Quanlong Wang (Quantinuum)\n  John van de Wetering (University of Amsterdam)\n  Alexander Wilce (Susquehanna University)\n  Mingsheng Ying (Tsinghua University)\n\n\nOrganising Committee\n\n\n  Ulysse Chabaud (Inria Paris, France)\n  Pierre-Emmanuel Emeriau (Quandela, France)\n  Shane Mansfield (Quandela, France)\n  Simon Perdrix           (Inria Nancy, France)\n  Benoît Valiron          (CentraleSupélec, Université Paris-Saclay, France)\n  Augustin Vanrietvelde   (Inria Saclay, France)\n  Renaud Vilmart          (Inria Saclay, France)\n  Vladimir Zamdzhiev      (Inria Saclay, France)\n\n\nFeel free to email Vladimir Zamdzhiev {first.last at inria dot fr} with any questions or concerns.\n\nQPL Steering Committee\n\n\n  Bob Coecke (Quantinuum)\n  Prakash Panangaden (McGill University)\n  Peter Selinger (Dalhousie University)\n\n\nPrevious QPL Editions\n\nAn archive of all previous QPL editions is available.\n\nCode of Conduct\n\nPlease make this conference a welcoming space for everyone.
