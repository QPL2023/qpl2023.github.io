    "content": "The 20th International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL 2023) will\ntake place from 17 July to 21 July 2023 at Institut Henri\nPoincaré in Paris, France.  Quantum Physics and Logic\nis an annual conference that brings together academic and industry researchers\nworking on mathematical foundations of quantum computation, quantum physics,\nand related areas. The main focus is on the use of algebraic and categorical\nstructures, formal languages, type systems, semantic methods, as well as other\nmathematical and computer scientific techniques applicable to the study of\nphysical systems, physical processes, and their composition. Work applying\nquantum-inspired techniques and structures to other fields (such as\nlinguistics, artificial intelligence, and causality) is also welcome.\n\nImportant Dates\n\n\n  Abstract submission deadline: 1 March 12 March 2023\n  Paper submission deadline: 7 March 17 March 2023\n  Notification: 1 May 2023\n  Registration deadline: TBA\n  Conference: 17 July – 21 July 2023\n\n\nAll deadlines are stated with respect to the Anywhere on Earth (AoE) time zone.\n\nSubmissions\n\nProspective speakers are invited to submit one (or more) of the following:\n\n\n  Proceedings submission. This consists of a 5-12 page paper. It must\nprovide sufficient evidence of results of genuine interest, in sufficient\ndetail for the program committee to assess the merits of the work.\nSubmissions of work in progress are encouraged, but must be more substantial\nthan a research proposal. Proceedings submissions should be prepared using\nthe EPTCS style files.\n  Non-proceedings submission. This consists of a 3 page summary, together with\na link to a separate published paper or preprint. If the published paper or\npreprint is not publicly available (e.g., not open access), then it should be\nincluded in full after the summary.\n  Poster submission. This consists of a 3 page abstract of partial results or\nwork in progress.\n  Programming tool submission. This consists of a 3 page description of a\nprogramming tool or framework, with a strong preference for open-source\ncontributions.\n\n\nPage limits exclude bibliography and appendices (which may be read at the\ndiscretion of reviewers). All submissions will be handled by\nEasyChair.\n\nThere will be an award for Best Student Paper that will be determined by the\nProgram Committee. Papers eligible for the award are those where all the\nauthors are students at the time of submission.\n\nPresentations\n\nAuthors of accepted proceedings and non-proceedings submissions will be invited\nto give a long or short talk, depending on the quality and maturity of the\nsubmission. Authors of accepted poster submissions will be invited to present\ntheir work at the poster session. Authors of accepted programming tool\nsubmissions will be invited to live demo their tool to conference attendees, at\nthe same time as the poster session.\n\nConference Proceedings\n\nConference proceedings will be published in Electronic Proceedings in\nTheoretical Computer Science (EPTCS) after the\nconference.\n\nLocal Information\n\nThe conference will take place at Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris, France.\n\n\n\nWe will update the website with more relevant information at a later time.\n\nQPL 2023 Programme Committee\n\nTBA\n\nQPL 2023 Organising Committee\n\n\n  Pierre-Emmanuel Emeriau (Quandela, France)\n  Shane Mansfield         (Quandela, France)\n  Simon Perdrix           (Inria Nancy, France)\n  Benoît Valiron          (CentraleSupélec, Université Paris-Saclay, France)\n  Augustin Vanrietvelde   (Inria Saclay, France)\n  Renaud Vilmart          (Inria Saclay, France)\n  Vladimir Zamdzhiev      (Inria Saclay, France)\n\n\nFeel free to email Vladimir Zamdzhiev {first.last at inria dot fr} with any questions or concerns.\n\nQPL Steering Committee\n\n\n  Bob Coecke (Quantinuum)\n  Prakash Panangaden (McGill University)\n  Peter Selinger (Dalhousie University)\n\n\nPrevious QPL Editions\n\nAn archive of all previous QPL editions is available.\n\nCopyright\n\nThe original image of the Louvre Museum (“La cour Napoléon du Musée du Louvre,\net sa pyramide, à la tombée de la nuit”) is by Benh LIEU SONG, it is licensed\nunder CC BY-SA 3.0 and it is\ntaken from\nWikipedia.\n",
